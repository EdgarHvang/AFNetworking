/**
 Creates an `AFHTTPRequestOperation`, setting the operation's request serializer and response serializers to those of the HTTP client.
 
 @param request The request object to be loaded asynchronously during execution of the operation.
 @param success A block object to be executed when the request operation finishes successfully. This block has no return value and takes two arguments: the created request operation and the object created from the response data of request.
 @param failure A block object to be executed when the request operation finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully, but encountered an error while parsing the response data. This block has no return value and takes two arguments:, the created request operation and the `NSError` object describing the network or parsing error that occurred.

 Cancels all operations in the HTTP client's operation queue whose URLs match the specified HTTP method and URL string.
 
 This method only cancels `AFHTTPRequestOperations` whose request URL matches the HTTP client base URL with the path appended. For complete control over the lifecycle of enqueued operations, you can access the `operationQueue` property directly, which allows you to, for instance, cancel operations filtered by a predicate, or simply use `-cancelAllRequests`. Note that the operation queue may include non-HTTP operations, so be sure to check the type before attempting to directly introspect an operation's `request` property.
 
 @param method The HTTP method to match for the cancelled requests, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`. If `nil`, all request operations with matching URLs will be cancelled.
 @param URLString The URL string used to create the request URL.
